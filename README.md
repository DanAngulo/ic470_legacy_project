## Description
A project to improve a game that we inherited.

## Installation
In order to be able to run the game npm is required along with the package.json provided within the files. The steps needed to run the game are below. 

## Usage
As a player, once the game is running you are presented with the option to immediately play or learn how to play. From there enjoy! 

## How to run the game

You need to have all the files cloned from this repo. 

package.json contains most of the dependancies but you will also need npm. 
So run: 
"""npm install"""
Then run:
"""npm run start"""
to get all the dependencies in package.json into your project.

There should then be a web page that can be found at:
localhost:8080
(8080 is a port number inside the project files that can be changed.)

## Support
If you find any bugs please contact m250162@usna.edu, m256828@usna.edu, or m250228@usna.edu. 

## Roadmap
In the future we plan on: 
- finishing debugging so that the game runs smoothly without crashing after a move.
- ensure home page runs smoothly. Currently laggy. 
- implementing messages to let players know what they did and when it's their turn.
